       you are the one i admired the one i loved
       also the one who made me feel beloved
       the one i trusted the one i believed
       the one with all my heart i lived....

       you are the one, in all my thoughts to dive
       who subjects me to dance the jive
       the one,for my smile to strive
       the one who makes me feel alive.....

       you are the one to make my heart smile
       the reason to skip its beat for a while
       the one with all the grace to arrive
       which makes me feel that i'm an electrophile......

       you are the one who can read my eyes
       even before i could apprise
       the one who deals with my stupid chastise
       and the one ,for all my worries to surmise.......

       Even today i feel it as a surprise
       the way you entered my akhdoosa life
       and enlighted it with smile of devise
       thank you for everything you beautifully incise..........
